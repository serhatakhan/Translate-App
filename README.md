# Translate App

This project is a user-friendly translation application that allows users to translate texts into different languages. Developed using **Redux Toolkit Thunk**, making it easy to manage asynchronous operations.

## Features

**`Language Selection:`** Users can select source and target languages. The source language is the original language of the text to be translated, while the target language is the language to which the text will be translated. Through React Select components, users can choose from a wide range of language options.

**`Text Translation:`** Users can enter the text they want to translate into the input area and then click the translate button between their selected source and target languages to translate the text.

**`Text Swapping:`** Users can also easily switch between source and target languages. When they click the "Swap" button, the selected languages and text areas automatically swap, and the translation process is performed according to the new target language.

**`Loading Indicator:`** A loading indicator is provided for users during the translation process. This visually indicates to the user that they can expect to wait while the translation process completes.

## Usage of Redux Toolkit Thunk

This project uses a Redux architecture managed with Redux Toolkit Thunk. This allows us to easily handle asynchronous operations. Particularly, API calls such as fetching language options and translating text are asynchronous operations, and managing these operations is straightforward with Redux Toolkit Thunk.

## How to Use ?

1. Run the application.
   
3. Select the source language and the target language.
   
5. Enter the text to be translated.
   
7. Click the "Translate" button.
   
9. See the translation result in the target language.
